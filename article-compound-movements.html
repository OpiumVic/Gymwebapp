  <!-- ========== ARTICLE BODY ========== -->
  <section class="article-body">
    <div class="article-content">

      <p>Your squat depth is lying to you. Your deadlift is destroying your lower back. Your bench press is tearing your shoulders apart one rep at a time. And you have no idea because no one has ever told you the truth about your form.</p>

      <p>Compound movements are the foundation of every serious training program. They recruit multiple muscle groups, allow you to move the heaviest loads, and drive the most systemic growth. But that same power makes them dangerous when executed poorly. A bad bicep curl wastes your time. A bad deadlift can end your training career.</p>

      <p>At SOSH, we see the same five form breakdowns every single day. Here is what they are, why they happen, and exactly how to fix them.</p>

      <h2>1. The Squat: Stop Doing Half Reps</h2>

      <p>The most common squat mistake is depth, or rather the total lack of it. If your hip crease is not dropping below your knee at the bottom of the rep, you are not squatting. You are doing a loaded knee bend, and you are leaving half the benefit on the table while putting disproportionate stress on your knees.</p>

      <p>Proper depth engages the glutes and hamstrings through their full range of motion. Cutting depth short shifts the load almost entirely to the quads and puts excessive shear force on the knee joint. It also limits the stretch reflex at the bottom of the squat, which is where most of your explosive power comes from.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>If you cannot squat to depth with a given weight, you cannot squat that weight. Drop the ego and drop the load.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>How to Fix It</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drop the weight by 20 to 30 percent</strong> and focus on hitting full depth with control. You will likely need to rebuild from a lighter base.</li>
        <li><strong>Work on ankle mobility.</strong> Tight ankles are the number one reason people cannot hit depth. Spend 5 minutes before squats doing banded ankle dorsiflexion stretches.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a box squat as a teaching tool.</strong> Set a box at parallel depth and squat to it on every rep. This gives you a physical target and teaches you what proper depth feels like.</li>
        <li><strong>Widen your stance slightly</strong> and angle your toes out 15 to 30 degrees. This opens the hips and creates more room for depth, especially if you have longer femurs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. The Deadlift: Your Back Is Not a Crane</h2>

      <p>The deadlift is the king of posterior chain development, but it is also the lift most likely to send you to a physical therapist if your form is off. The most common error is rounding the lower back during the pull, turning what should be a hip hinge into a spinal flexion exercise.</p>

      <p>When your lower back rounds under load, the intervertebral discs absorb force they were never designed to handle in that position. The erector muscles lose their mechanical advantage, and the load transfers directly to passive structures like ligaments and disc material. This is how herniated discs happen.</p>

      <h3>How to Fix It</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set your back before you pull.</strong> Before every rep, take a deep breath into your belly, brace your core like you are about to get punched, and pull your chest up. You should feel your lats engage and your lower back lock into a neutral or slightly extended position.</li>
        <li><strong>Push the floor away</strong> instead of pulling the bar up. This mental cue shifts the movement pattern from a back-dominant pull to a leg-dominant push, which is mechanically what the deadlift should be off the floor.</li>
        <li><strong>Record yourself from the side.</strong> Lower back rounding is nearly impossible to feel when it is happening. Video does not lie. Film your working sets and compare your back angle from the start of the pull to mid-shin height.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-label">SOSH PRO TIP</span>
        <p>If you cannot maintain a flat back from the floor, try pulling from blocks or a rack set at mid-shin height. Reduce the range of motion until your mobility allows you to pull from the floor with integrity.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>3. The Bench Press: Your Shoulders Are Screaming</h2>

      <p>The bench press is not a shoulder exercise, but most people turn it into one by pressing with flared elbows and flat shoulder blades. This position puts the shoulder joint in its most vulnerable configuration under maximum load. The rotator cuff gets impinged, the biceps tendon gets irritated, and over time, something gives.</p>

      <h3>How to Fix It</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Retract and depress your shoulder blades</strong> before unracking the bar. Pull your shoulders back and down into the bench like you are trying to put your shoulder blades in your back pockets. This creates a stable shelf to press from and protects the shoulder joint.</li>
        <li><strong>Tuck your elbows to 45 degrees.</strong> Your upper arms should make roughly a 45-degree angle with your torso at the bottom of the rep, not 90 degrees. This loads the pecs and triceps effectively while keeping the shoulders in a safer position.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain an arch.</strong> A slight natural arch in the lower back is not cheating. It is biomechanically optimal. The arch shortens the range of motion, puts the pecs in a stronger position, and helps maintain shoulder blade retraction throughout the set.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. The Overhead Press: Stop Leaning Back</h2>

      <p>The standing overhead press is one of the best upper body movements for building real-world strength and shoulder stability. But the moment the weight gets heavy, most lifters start leaning back to turn it into an incline press. This puts your lower back under compression in its most vulnerable position and turns a shoulder exercise into a spinal injury waiting to happen.</p>

      <h3>How to Fix It</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Squeeze your glutes and brace your core</strong> before every rep. Think of your torso as a rigid cylinder. If your glutes and abs are tight, your spine cannot hyperextend.</li>
        <li><strong>Move your head out of the way, not your spine.</strong> As the bar passes your face, push your chin back slightly to create a clear bar path. Once the bar clears, drive your head through so it ends directly under the bar at lockout.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a belt for heavier sets.</strong> A weightlifting belt gives your core something to brace against, providing additional spinal stability and making it easier to maintain a neutral torso.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. The Barbell Row: You're Using Momentum, Not Muscle</h2>

      <p>The barbell row builds the thick upper back that makes or breaks a physique, but most people turn it into a jerky, momentum-driven swing that barely works the target muscles. If your torso is bouncing up and down like a seesaw and the bar is crashing into your stomach, you are not rowing. You are using your lower back as a catapult.</p>

      <h3>How to Fix It</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Slow down the eccentric.</strong> Lower the bar under control for a full 2-second count on every rep. If you cannot control the weight on the way down, it is too heavy.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain a consistent torso angle.</strong> Your back should stay at roughly 45 degrees to the floor throughout the entire set. If your torso rises more than 10 degrees during the pull, you are using momentum to move the weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull to your lower chest or upper abdomen.</strong> Think about driving your elbows toward the ceiling rather than pulling the bar with your hands. This cue activates the lats and rhomboids more effectively and reduces bicep dominance in the movement.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-label">SOSH PRO TIP</span>
        <p>Film yourself from the side on your rowing sets. The torso angle test is the fastest way to identify if you are cheating the movement. If your back angle changes significantly during the set, drop the weight until it does not.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>Compound movements are non-negotiable for anyone serious about building strength and muscle. But they demand respect. Every rep is an opportunity to build your body or break it down. The difference is form.</p>

      <p>Check your ego at the door. Film your lifts. Ask a coach to watch your sets. The strongest people in every gym are not the ones moving the most weight. They are the ones moving weight with the most precision. Fix these five movements, and everything else in your training will improve.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your technique.</p>
      </blockquote>
