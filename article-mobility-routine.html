        <h1>The 10-Minute Mobility Routine That Prevents 90% of Injuries</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ========== ARTICLE BODY ========== -->
  <section class="article-body">
    <div class="article-content">

      <p>You walk into the gym. You load the bar. You start lifting. No warm-up. No mobility work. Just straight into the heavy stuff because you are short on time and warming up is boring. Sound familiar?</p>

      <p>This approach works fine until it does not. And when it stops working, it stops hard. A tweaked lower back on a deadlift. A shoulder that catches on every overhead press. A hip that screams at the bottom of every squat. These are not random injuries. They are predictable consequences of taking a cold, stiff body and asking it to produce maximal force through full ranges of motion.</p>

      <p>The good news is that the fix takes 10 minutes. The routine we are about to share is the same one our SOSH coaches use with every athlete, from beginners to competitive powerlifters. It targets the joints and movement patterns most vulnerable during resistance training and takes your body from cold and restricted to warm and ready to perform.</p>

      <h2>Why Mobility Matters More Than Flexibility</h2>

      <p>Mobility and flexibility are not the same thing. Flexibility is your passive range of motion, how far a joint can move when an external force (like gravity or a partner) pushes it. Mobility is your active range of motion, how far you can move a joint under your own muscular control and strength.</p>

      <p>You can be extremely flexible and still get injured because your muscles cannot control your joints through that full range. A gymnast doing the splits has both flexibility and mobility. Someone who can touch their toes but cannot control a deep squat has flexibility without mobility. For lifters, mobility is what matters because you need to control heavy loads through full ranges of motion.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Flexibility without strength is just instability waiting for a load to expose it. Mobility is flexibility you own.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The SOSH 10-Minute Mobility Flow</h2>

      <p>Perform this routine before every training session. Each movement takes approximately one minute. No equipment needed except a resistance band for one exercise.</p>

      <h3>1. Cat-Cow Spinal Waves (60 seconds)</h3>

      <p>Start on your hands and knees with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. On an inhale, drop your belly toward the floor, lift your chest, and look up (cow position). On an exhale, round your spine toward the ceiling, tuck your chin, and draw your belly button toward your spine (cat position). Move slowly and rhythmically, spending about 3 seconds in each position.</p>

      <p>This warms up the entire spine, lubricates the intervertebral discs, and activates the deep spinal stabilizers that protect your back during heavy lifting.</p>

      <h3>2. World's Greatest Stretch (60 seconds per side)</h3>

      <p>Step your right foot outside your right hand in a deep lunge position. Place your left hand on the floor for support. Rotate your torso to the right and reach your right arm toward the ceiling. Hold for 2 seconds, then return your right hand to the floor. Repeat 5 times per side.</p>

      <p>This single exercise opens the hip flexors, adductors, thoracic spine, and shoulders simultaneously. It is called the world's greatest stretch for a reason. If you could only do one mobility exercise before training, this would be it.</p>

      <h3>3. Hip 90/90 Rotations (60 seconds)</h3>

      <p>Sit on the floor with both knees bent at 90 degrees. Your front shin should be directly in front of you, and your rear shin should be directly to your side. Keeping your chest tall, rotate both legs to the opposite side so the positions reverse. Move back and forth slowly, spending 2 to 3 seconds on each side.</p>

      <p>This targets internal and external hip rotation, the two movement capacities most responsible for hip pain and restricted squat depth. If your hips feel tight in the bottom of a squat, this exercise will make an immediate difference.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-label">SOSH PRO TIP</span>
        <p>If the 90/90 position is uncomfortable or you cannot keep your chest upright, place your hands behind you for support. Over time, you will develop enough hip mobility to perform the movement hands-free. Do not force the range. Let your nervous system open it up gradually.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>4. Banded Shoulder Dislocates (60 seconds)</h3>

      <p>Hold a resistance band with a wide grip in front of your body. Keeping your arms straight, slowly raise the band overhead and continue the arc until it reaches behind your back. Reverse the motion back to the starting position. Use a grip width that allows you to complete the movement without bending your elbows.</p>

      <p>This exercise restores full overhead range of motion and warms up the rotator cuff, rear deltoids, and scapular stabilizers. It is essential before any pressing or overhead work and helps prevent the shoulder impingement that plagues so many lifters.</p>

      <h3>5. Deep Squat Hold with Thoracic Rotation (60 seconds)</h3>

      <p>Drop into a deep squat position with your feet slightly wider than hip width and toes turned out 15 to 30 degrees. Use your elbows to push your knees apart. From this position, place one hand on the floor and reach the other arm toward the ceiling, rotating through your mid-back. Hold for 3 seconds, then switch sides. Alternate for the full 60 seconds.</p>

      <p>This combines a deep squat stretch for the hips, ankles, and adductors with thoracic spine rotation. It mimics the bottom position of a squat while mobilizing the upper back, making it the perfect bridge between warm-up and barbell work.</p>

      <h3>6. Ankle Dorsiflexion Mobilization (60 seconds)</h3>

      <p>Stand facing a wall with one foot about 4 inches from the wall. Keeping your heel on the ground, drive your knee forward over your toes toward the wall. If your knee can touch the wall easily, move your foot back slightly. If your knee cannot reach the wall, move closer. Find the distance where you feel a moderate stretch in the back of your ankle and calf. Perform 15 repetitions per side.</p>

      <p>Limited ankle dorsiflexion is the silent killer of squat depth and quality. If your ankles are stiff, your heels rise, your knees cave in, and your lower back rounds to compensate. This simple drill addresses the root cause of most squat form breakdowns.</p>

      <h3>7. Dead Hang (60 seconds)</h3>

      <p>Grab a pull-up bar with an overhand grip and hang with straight arms, letting your bodyweight decompress your spine and stretch your lats, shoulders, and grip. Breathe deeply and relax into the hang. If 60 seconds is too difficult at first, break it into 2 to 3 shorter sets.</p>

      <p>The dead hang decompresses the spine after a day of sitting, opens the shoulders for pressing and pulling movements, and builds grip endurance. It is the simplest and most underrated mobility tool in the gym.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-label">SOSH PRO TIP</span>
        <p>Do the dead hang as your very last warm-up exercise, right before you touch the barbell. The spinal decompression and lat stretch it provides sets your body up perfectly for squats, deadlifts, and overhead pressing. Many of our athletes report an immediate improvement in squat depth after hanging for 60 seconds.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>When to Do This Routine</h2>

      <p>Perform this flow before every single training session. All seven movements. Every time. No exceptions. It takes 10 minutes, and it can save you months of rehab from an injury that was entirely preventable.</p>

      <p>On rest days, you can also perform the routine first thing in the morning to counteract the stiffness from sleep and reduce general tightness from sitting. Several SOSH members do the full flow every morning regardless of whether they train, and they report significantly less joint pain and better overall movement quality.</p>

      <h2>What About Static Stretching?</h2>

      <p>Save static stretching for after your workout, not before. Static stretching before lifting has been shown to temporarily reduce force production and may increase injury risk by desensitizing your stretch reflex, the neurological mechanism that protects your muscles from being pulled beyond safe limits. Dynamic mobility work like the routine above increases blood flow, activates the nervous system, and prepares your joints for loaded movement without compromising performance.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>Ten minutes. Seven movements. Zero equipment beyond a resistance band. That is all it takes to protect your joints, improve your movement quality, and dramatically reduce your risk of the injuries that sideline most lifters at some point in their careers.</p>

      <p>The warm-up is not optional. It is not a waste of time. It is the insurance policy that keeps you training for decades instead of weeks. Treat these 10 minutes with the same respect you give your heaviest set, because without them, you may not get to do that heavy set at all.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The best ability is availability. You cannot make progress if you are injured. Ten minutes of mobility today is worth ten weeks of physical therapy tomorrow.</p>
      </blockquote>
